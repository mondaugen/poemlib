INSTALLING
----------

Compiler:

  This uses clang. If you want to use a different compiler, change the CXX
  variable in Makefile.

Database library:

  This uses kyotocabinet and assumes the dylib image can be found at

    /usr/local/lib/libkyotocabinet.dylib

  If you want to put it somewhere else or you are not on OS X, change the LIB
  variable in Makefile to your preferred path.

  kyotocabinet can be found here:

    http://fallabs.com/kyotocabinet/

once that is done run:

$make
