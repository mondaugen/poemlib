THE REVEREND CARRION CROW
WHAT IS WEIGHT REALLY WHEN YOU SAY THE WEIGHT
IN TWO DAYS HE HAD SAILED FOR HOME
THE ANNUAL DINNER YOU KNOW
ARE YOU NOT HAPPY IN YOUR HOME
THE NUMBER OF BIRDS IN DIFFERENT STATES
HE FRETS HER LIKE A MOSQUITO
YOU DON'T STAND FOR THAT I SUPPOSE
CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES
TIS IRON THAT I KNOW NOT GOLD
ARE THERE COUNTY POOR HOUSES IN THIS STATE
YOU REMEMBER THE CHILDS FRATRICIDE CASE
A SCARED CALF'S FACE GILDED WITH MARMALADE
BUT BEING BROUGHT BACK TO LIFE NO
YELLOW POISON STREAKS ARE ON THE DRAWN FACE
MAKE THE SIGN OF CUTTING THE THROAT
